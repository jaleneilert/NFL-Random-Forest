### About the Project
The dataset I am using is NFL passing statistics between the years 2001 to 2023. The goal for my
model is to predict the number of touchdowns a player will have based on their passing statistics.
Some of the features include, games started, attempted passes, passing completions, total yards, and
interceptions

The notebooks include my steps in data preprocessing, training, and testing the Random Forest Regression model. 
*ML Project last edited December 2024 to utilize time series cross validation to improve model accuracy *
